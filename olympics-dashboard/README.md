Three main success factors have been identified in this analysis.
- **Category** explains most of the success probability, with only three of them having more than half of all projects accomplishing the goal.
- **Project goal** is the second best predictor of the odds of raising enough money. Unsurprisingly, the less ambitious projects are, the most likely they are to being fully funded.
- **Launch quarter** is the weakest projects success predictor of all, being the second and third quarters slightly (up to 8%) better for fundraising.

### Other conclusions
The 10 most backed (by % pledged) projects come exclusively from the categories **GAMES** and **DESIGN**, so, these two may be good to look for outstanding startups.

Finally, there has been an steady improvement in the project success rates in the past 4 years and the trend is expected to continue. **Hypothesis**: better policies for publishing projects within Kickstarter, which would explain the steep decline in $0 pledged projects starting on 2014.

### Suggested investment strategy
Strategy should have the objective of maximizing profitability, by diversifying investment into three tiers, taking into account success factors above mentioned. All projects should be selected from those having the category LIVE.
- **10% High risk**, high investment (*TECH* category). Suggested goal: **25K**.
- **30% Mid risk**, mid investment (*DESIGN, GAMES*). Suggested goal: **10K**.
- **60% Low risk**, low investment (*DANCE, THEATER, COMICS*). Suggested goal: **5K**.

Ideally, projects should be selected from those starting on **Q2** and **Q3**.
