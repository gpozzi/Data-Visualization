### Summary

>For the Maven Restaurant Challenge, you will be assuming the role of Lead Analyst at a firm that invests in new restaurant opportunities abroad. After conducting a study to learn about the restaurant market in several Mexican cities, you've been asked to analyze interesting patterns and trends in the data to help understand the market and make investment decisions.

>Your task is to share a single-page visual or dashboard that outlines what you'd be looking for in a restaurant to invest in and contains the supporting data from your analysis. [full details of the challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-restaurant-challenge).

### Questions to answer

- What type of demographics should we target?
- What service variables correlate best with a high service rating?
- What food type do low, medium and high budget customers that are generally satisfied with the food prefer?
- Does smoking allowance correlate with a low service rating?
- Are there low budget consumers that prefer a high budget restaurant?
- Is food percieved best if a restaurant is not a franchise?
- Do drinkers and smokers feel most at ease with drink and smoking allowance?

### Data nuances
Even though a thorough analysis will be conducted and conclusions will be made for the sake of practice, this dataset has a non representative sample size and does not ensure data is not biased since collection methods are not specified. For that reason, no investment strategies should be suggested by this data alone and additional information should be collected in order to ensure solid data driven investment decisions.
